# Contour-Plots-
Contour plots (sometimes called Level Plots) are a way to show a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. It graphs two predictor variables X Y on the y-axis and a response variable Z as contours. These contours are sometimes called z-slices or iso-response values.
This type of chart is commonly used in mapping where the contour lines of a topological map show the same heights. Many other students use contours, including astrology, meteorology, and physics. Contours generally indicate the height (such as the height of geographic features), but can also be used to indicate density, brightness, or electrical potential.

Contour drawing is a graphical technique for representing a three-dimensional surface by drawing constant Z-sections, called contours, in a two-dimensional format. That is, given a value for z, lines are drawn to join the (x, y) coordinates at which this z value appears.

A contour plot is appropriate if you want to see how some value Z changes as a function of two inputs, X and Y:

z = f(x, y)

A contour line (also isoline, isoplet, or isarithm) of a two-variable function is a curve along which the function has a constant value so that the curve connects points of equal value. It is a flat section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f (x, y) parallel to the plane x, y. In cartography, a contour line (often called simply "contour") connects points of equal height (height) above a certain level, such as mean sea level. An overview map is a map illustrated by contour lines, for example, a topographic map showing valleys and hills as well as slope or slope smoothing. The contour interval of a contour map is the height difference between successive contour lines.
